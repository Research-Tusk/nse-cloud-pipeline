"""
Shared intraday-revenue snapshot + EOD-prediction logic for NSE and BSE live pollers.

GitHub Actions' cron scheduler is documented as best-effort and, under load,
fires this repo's every-5-minute live pollers only a handful of times across
a trading day rather than every 5 minutes as scheduled — a platform
limitation, not a bug in the poller. The old design required a poll to land
in a narrow window around each hour mark (e.g. "within the first 5 minutes
of the hour") to count as that hour's checkpoint, which meant the archive
silently starved once runs stopped landing precisely on time.

This version records every successful poll's (elapsed_minutes, revenue)
point unconditionally, however sparse or irregularly-timed. The fixed
hour-mark checkpoints used for the historical "% of EOD revenue by hour N"
model are derived after the fact by linearly interpolating between whichever
two actual samples happen to bracket that checkpoint each day (with a
synthetic (0 min, ₹0) anchor at market open, since revenue is definitionally
zero then). A day is archived — and its checkpoints computed — the next time
a new day's first sample arrives, using whatever samples were collected as
long as the last one is late enough in the session to trust as an EOD proxy.

Weekday classification per exchange:
  NSE: Tuesday = expiry day. If Tuesday is a holiday, Monday becomes expiry.
       Monday (before a Tuesday expiry) = pre-expiry.
  BSE: Thursday = expiry day. If Thursday is a holiday, Wednesday becomes expiry.
       Wednesday (before a Thursday expiry) = pre-expiry.
